# YouTube Clone

This is a YouTube clone project built using React and Redux. It aims to replicate the core features and user interface of the popular video-sharing platform. The clone provides a familiar experience for users to browse and watch videos, search for content, view channel details, and interact with video comments.

## Features

- **Video Playback**: Users can watch videos with a built-in video player that supports basic playback controls such as play, pause, seek, and volume control.

- **Video Search**: Users can search for videos using keywords or phrases and receive relevant search results.

- **Video Recommendations**: Based on the current video being watched, the clone suggests related videos for users to explore and discover new content.

- **Channel Pages**: Users can view channel details, including the channel name, description, subscriber count, and uploaded video playlists.

- **Video Comments**: You provides only two level nested comment, but in this projrct you will get n-level nested comment section

- **Live Chat**: Made a YouTube like Live chat using api polling
